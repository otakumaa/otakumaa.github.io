Hi i'm Bryce Ancheta, I was born and raised in Sacramento, i have been working all my life from working in my family's dry cleaning store to being where I am now as a manager at Amazon. I feel now as if i am reaching the end of my journey at my current career path, I am extremely grateful for all the opportunities I have been given but I feel there is no happiness for me at the end of this path. Which is what brings me here,for once actually following my dream I had since I was a kid, I want to do something I am passionate for and i believe this to be it. From what I have experienced so far just going through the First Mile I am so excited for what is to come later in the program. My wife has actually had to yell at me to stop doing the assignments through the night and get some sleep but all these new concepts are so exciting that i just want to keep going and go as fast as I can. So in short I am finally investing in myself and my future for what I think is going to make me happy and I believe I made the right choice. 

THANK YOU TO MY AWESOME COHORT FOR THE SUPPORT SO FAR AND MY COHORT LEAD CORRINNA!
